# DIN-UD5
Sample code for DIN UD5 Data Layer Access: Enterprise Information System Integration

Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for a Java EE web application exposing a CRUD functionality by a RESTful service.
This server side application includes JPA entities for accessing data in a MySQL database and an EJB implementation for the CRUD operations.
The application can be used by any application implementing the appropriate REST client. 
The <a href="https://github.com/uriajavi/DIN-UD5-ClientSide">DIN-UD5-ClientSide repo</a> contains a JavaFX client application for this.
